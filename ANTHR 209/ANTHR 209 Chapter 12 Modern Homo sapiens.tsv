African multiregionalism	The idea that modern Homo sapiens evolved as a complex web of small regional populations with sporadic gene flow among them.
Agriculture	The mass production of resources through farming and domestication.
Aquaculture	The farming of fish using techniques such as trapping, channels, and artificial ponds.
Assimilation hypothesis	Current theory of modern human origins stating that the species evolved first in Africa and interbred with archaic humans of Europe and Asia.
Atlatl	A handheld spear thrower that increased the force of thrown projectiles.
Band	A small group of people living together as foragers.
Beringia	Ancient landmass that connected Siberia and Alaska. The ancestors of Indigenous Americans would have crossed this area to reach the Americas.
Carrying capacity	The amount of organisms that an environment can reliably support.
Coastal Route model	Theory that the first Paleoindians crossed to the Americas by following the southern coast of Beringia.
Early Modern Homo sapiens, Early Anatomically Modern Human	Terms used to refer to transitional fossils between archaic and modern Homo sapiens that have a mosaic of traits. Humans like ourselves, who mostly lack archaic traits, are referred to as Late Modern Homo sapiens and simply Anatomically Modern Humans.
Egalitarian	Human organization without strict ranks. Foraging societies tend to be more egalitarian than those based on other subsistence strategies.
Foraging	Lifestyle consisting of frequent movement through the landscape and acquiring resources with minimal storage capacity.
Generalist-specialist niche	The ability to survive in a variety of environments by developing local expertise. Evolution toward this niche may have been what allowed modern Homo sapiens to expand past the geographical range of other human species.
Globalization	A recent increase in the interconnectedness and interdependence of people that is facilitated with long-distance networks.
Globular	Having a rounded appearance. Increased globularity of the braincase is a trait of modern Homo sapiens.
Gracile	Having a smooth and slender quality; the opposite of robust.
Holocene	The epoch of the Cenozoic Era starting around 12,000 years ago and lasting arguably through the present.
Ice-Free Corridor model	Theory that the first Native Americans crossed to the Americas through a passage between glaciers.
Institutions	Long-lasting and influential cultural constructs. Examples include government, organized religion, academia, and the economy.
Last Glacial Maximum	The time 23,000 years ago when the most recent ice age was the most intense.
Later Stone Age	Time period following the Middle Stone Age with a diversification in tool types, starting around 50,000 years ago.
Levant	The eastern coast of the Mediterranean. The site of early modern human expansion from Africa and later one of the centers of agriculture.
Megafauna	Large ancient animals that may have been hunted to extinction by people around the world.
Mental eminence	The chin on the mandible of modern H. sapiens. One of the defining traits of our species.
Microlith	Small stone tool found in the Later Stone Age; also called a bladelet.
Middle Stone Age	Time period known for Mousterian lithics that connects African archaic to modern Homo sapiens.
Monumental architecture	Large and labor-intensive constructions that signify the power of the elite in a sedentary society. A common type is the pyramid, a raised crafted structure topped with a point or platform.
Mosaic	Composed from a mix or composite of traits.
Neolithic Revolution	Time of rapid change to human cultures due to the invention of agriculture, starting around 12,000 years ago.
Ochre	Iron-based mineral pigment that can be a variety of yellows, reds, and browns. Used by modern human cultures worldwide since at least 80,000 years ago.
Sahul	Ancient landmass connecting New Guinea and Australia.
Sedentarism	Lifestyle based on having a stable home area; the opposite of nomadism.
Southern Dispersal model	Theory that modern H. sapiens expanded from East Africa by crossing the Red Sea and following the coast east across Asia.
Subsistence strategy	The method an organism uses to find nourishment and other resources.
Sunda	Ancient Asian landmass that incorporated modern Southeast Asia.
Supraorbital torus	The bony brow ridge across the top of the eye orbits on many hominin crania.
Upper Paleolithic	Time period considered synonymous with the Later Stone Age.
Urbanization	The increase of population density as people settled together in cities.
Wallacea	Archipelago southeast of Sunda with different biodiversity than Asia.
Younger Dryas	The rapid change in global climate—notably a cooling of the Northern Hemisphere—13,000 years ago.
