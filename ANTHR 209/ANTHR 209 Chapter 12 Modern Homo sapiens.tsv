The idea that modern Homo sapiens evolved as a complex web of small regional populations with sporadic gene flow among them.	African multiregionalism
The mass production of resources through farming and domestication.	Agriculture
The farming of fish using techniques such as trapping, channels, and artificial ponds.	Aquaculture
Current theory of modern human origins stating that the species evolved first in Africa and interbred with archaic humans of Europe and Asia.	Assimilation hypothesis
A handheld spear thrower that increased the force of thrown projectiles.	Atlatl
A small group of people living together as foragers.	Band
Ancient landmass that connected Siberia and Alaska. The ancestors of Indigenous Americans would have crossed this area to reach the Americas.	Beringia
The amount of organisms that an environment can reliably support.	Carrying capacity
Theory that the first Paleoindians crossed to the Americas by following the southern coast of Beringia.	Coastal Route model
Terms used to refer to transitional fossils between archaic and modern Homo sapiens that have a mosaic of traits. Humans like ourselves, who mostly lack archaic traits, are referred to as Late Modern Homo sapiens and simply Anatomically Modern Humans.	Early Modern Homo sapiens, Early Anatomically Modern Human
Human organization without strict ranks. Foraging societies tend to be more egalitarian than those based on other subsistence strategies.	Egalitarian
Lifestyle consisting of frequent movement through the landscape and acquiring resources with minimal storage capacity.	Foraging
The ability to survive in a variety of environments by developing local expertise. Evolution toward this niche may have been what allowed modern Homo sapiens to expand past the geographical range of other human species.	Generalist-specialist niche
A recent increase in the interconnectedness and interdependence of people that is facilitated with long-distance networks.	Globalization
Having a rounded appearance. Increased globularity of the braincase is a trait of modern Homo sapiens.	Globular
Having a smooth and slender quality; the opposite of robust.	Gracile
The epoch of the Cenozoic Era starting around 12,000 years ago and lasting arguably through the present.	Holocene
Theory that the first Native Americans crossed to the Americas through a passage between glaciers.	Ice-Free Corridor model
Long-lasting and influential cultural constructs. Examples include government, organized religion, academia, and the economy.	Institutions
The time 23,000 years ago when the most recent ice age was the most intense.	Last Glacial Maximum
Time period following the Middle Stone Age with a diversification in tool types, starting around 50,000 years ago.	Later Stone Age
The eastern coast of the Mediterranean. The site of early modern human expansion from Africa and later one of the centers of agriculture.	Levant
Large ancient animals that may have been hunted to extinction by people around the world.	Megafauna
The chin on the mandible of modern H. sapiens. One of the defining traits of our species.	Mental eminence
Small stone tool found in the Later Stone Age; also called a bladelet.	Microlith
Time period known for Mousterian lithics that connects African archaic to modern Homo sapiens.	Middle Stone Age
Large and labor-intensive constructions that signify the power of the elite in a sedentary society. A common type is the pyramid, a raised crafted structure topped with a point or platform.	Monumental architecture
Composed from a mix or composite of traits.	Mosaic
Time of rapid change to human cultures due to the invention of agriculture, starting around 12,000 years ago.	Neolithic Revolution
Iron-based mineral pigment that can be a variety of yellows, reds, and browns. Used by modern human cultures worldwide since at least 80,000 years ago.	Ochre
Ancient landmass connecting New Guinea and Australia.	Sahul
Lifestyle based on having a stable home area; the opposite of nomadism.	Sedentarism
Theory that modern H. sapiens expanded from East Africa by crossing the Red Sea and following the coast east across Asia.	Southern Dispersal model
The method an organism uses to find nourishment and other resources.	Subsistence strategy
Ancient Asian landmass that incorporated modern Southeast Asia.	Sunda
The bony brow ridge across the top of the eye orbits on many hominin crania.	Supraorbital torus
Time period considered synonymous with the Later Stone Age.	Upper Paleolithic
The increase of population density as people settled together in cities.	Urbanization
Archipelago southeast of Sunda with different biodiversity than Asia.	Wallacea
The rapid change in global climate—notably a cooling of the Northern Hemisphere—13,000 years ago.	Younger Dryas
