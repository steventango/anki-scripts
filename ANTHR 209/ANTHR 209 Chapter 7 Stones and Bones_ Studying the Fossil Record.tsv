An oxygen-free environment.	Anaerobic
The proposed name for our current geologic epoch based on human-driven climate change.	Anthropocene
A chronometric dating method that measures the ratio of argon gas in volcanic rock to estimate time elapsed since the volcanic rock cooled and solidified. See also potassium-argon dating.	Argon-argon (Ar-Ar) dating
A small building block of matter.	Atom
Hard, concrete-like substances found in the intestines of fossil creatures.	Bezoars
A relative dating method that uses other plant and animal remains occurring in the stratigraphic context to establish time depth.	Biostratigraphy
Billion years ago.	Bya
Dating methods that give estimated numbers of years for artifacts and sites.	Chronometric dating
The slow movement of continents over time.	Continental drift
Fossilized poop.	Coprolite
The relative dating method that arranges human-made artifacts in a time frame from oldest to youngest based on material, production technique, style, and other features.	Cultural dating
James Hutton’s theory that the world was much older than biblical explanations allowed. This age could be determined by gradual natural processes like soil erosion.	Deep Time
A chronometric dating method that uses the annual growth of trees to build a timeline into the past.	Dendrochronology
A chronometric dating method that measures the background radiation accumulated in material over time.	Electron spin resonance dating
Matter that cannot be broken down into smaller matter.	Element
The largest unit of geologic time, spanning billions of years and divided into subunits called eras, periods, and epochs.	Eon
The smallest units of geologic time, spanning thousands to millions of years.	Epochs
Units of geologic time that span millions to billions of years and that are subdivided into periods and epochs.	Eras
A chronometric dating method that is based on the fission of 283U.	Fission track dating
A relative dating method that analyzes the absorption of fluorine in bones from the surrounding soils.	Fluorine dating
Single-celled marine organisms with shells.	Foraminifera
The process by which an organism becomes a fossil.	Fossilization
Mineralized copies of organisms or activity imprints.	Fossils
The study of the physical characteristics of the Earth’s surface.	Geomorphology
Periods characterized by low global temperatures and the expansion of ice sheets on Earth’s surface.	Glacial periods
The geologic epoch from 10 kya to present. (See the discussion on “the Anthropocene” for the debate regarding the current epoch name.)	Holocene
The term used for humans and their ancestors after the split with chimpanzees and bonobos.	Hominin
When a fossil is embedded in a substance, such as igneous rock.	In matrix
Variants of elements.	Isotopes
Thousand years ago.	Kya
The scientific law that states that rock and soil are deposited in layers, with the youngest layers on top and the oldest layers on the bottom.	Law of Superposition
The process by which the pressure of sediments squeeze extra water out of decaying remains and replace the voids that appear with minerals from the surrounding soil and groundwater.	Lithification
The chronometric dating method based on the buildup of background radiation in pottery, clay, and soils.	Luminescence dating
Large animals such as mammoths and mastodons.	Megafauna
DNA located in the mitochondria of a cell that is only passed down from biological mother to child.	Mitochondrial DNA
Million years ago.	Mya
Study of ancient diseases and injuries identified through examining remains.	Paleopathology
Geologic time units that span millions of years and are subdivided into epochs.	Periods
When minerals from water impregnate or replace organic remains, leaving a fossilized copy of the organism.	Permineralization
A fossilized piece of wood in which the original organism is completely replaced by minerals through petrifaction.	Petrified wood
A chronometric dating method that measures the ratio of argon gas in volcanic rock to estimate time elapsed since the volcanic rock cooled and solidified. See also argon-argon dating.	Potassium-argon (K-Ar) dating
Natural rocks or mineral formations that can be mistaken for fossils.	Pseudofossils
The process of transforming the atom by spontaneously releasing energy.	Radioactive decay
The chronometric dating method based on the radioactive decay of 14C in organic remains.	Radiocarbon dating
Dating methods that do not result in numbers of years but, rather, in relative timelines wherein some organisms or artifacts are older or younger than others.	Relative dating
Core samples taken from lake beds or other water sources for analysis of their pollen.	Sediment cores
Variants of elements that do not change over time without outside interference.	Stable isotopes
A relative dating method that is based on ordered layers or (strata) that build up over time.	Stratigraphy
The study of what happens to an organism after death.	Taphonomy
Fossilized remains of activity such as footprints.	Trace fossils
The theoretical perspective that the geologic processes observed today are the same as the processes operating in the past.	Uniformitarianism
Variants of elements that spontaneously change into stable isotopes over time.	Unstable isotopes
A radiometric dating method based on the decay chain of unstable isotopes of 238U and 235U.	Uranium series dating
