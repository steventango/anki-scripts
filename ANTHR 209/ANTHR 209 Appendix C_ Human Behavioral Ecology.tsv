It represents the fertility of all females in a given year. It is reported as children per woman.	Total fertility rate
An explanation for an event that is further removed than a proximate explanation but provides a greater insight or understanding. In human behavioral ecology, ultimate explanations usually describe how a behavior is linked to reproduction and survival.	Ultimate explanation
