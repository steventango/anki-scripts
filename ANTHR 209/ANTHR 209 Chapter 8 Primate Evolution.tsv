Order: Primates. One of the earliest groups of euprimates (true primates; earliest records from the early Eocene).	Adapoidea
Rapid diversifications of single lineages into many species which may present unique morphological features in response to different ecological settings.	Adaptive radiations
Features that were inherited from a common ancestor and which remain (largely) unchanged.	Ancestral traits
Group containing monkeys and apes, including humans.	Anthropoids
The rounded bony floor of the middle ear cavity.	Auditory bulla
Dental condition in which the cusps of molar teeth form ridges (or lophs) separated from each other by valleys (seen, e.g., in modern catarrhine monkeys).	Bilophodonty
Order: Primates; Suborder: Anthropoidea; Infraorder: Catarrhini. Group, with origins in Africa and Asia, that contains monkeys and apes, including humans.	Catarrhines
Group containing all of the descendants of a single ancestor. A portion of a phylogenetic tree represented as a bifurcation (node) in a lineage and all of the branches leading forward in time from that bifurcation.	Clade
The independent evolution of a morphological feature in animals not closely related (e.g., wings in birds and bats).	Convergent evolution
Smallest monophyletic group (clade) containing a specified set of extant taxa and all descendants of their last common ancestor.	Crown
Space between adjacent teeth.	Diastema
The ecological interaction between whole groups of species (e.g., primates) with whole groups of other species (e.g., fruiting trees).	Diffuse coevolution
Bony ring or tube that holds the tympanic membrane (eardrum).	Ectotympanic
Order: Primates. True primates or primates of modern aspect.	Euprimates
Group containing catarrhines, platyrrhines, and tarsiers.	Haplorhines
Modern humans and any extinct relatives more closely related to us than to chimpanzees.	Hominins
Fibrocartilaginous joint between the left and right mandibular segments, located in the midline of the body.	Mandibular symphysis
Order: Primates; Superfamily: Omomyoidea. One of the earliest groups of euprimates (true primates; earliest record in the early Eocene).	Omomyoidea
The portion of the temporal bone that houses the inner ear apparatus.	Petrosal bone
Dental condition where at least one of the lower cheek-teeth (molars or premolars) is a laterally compressed blade.	Plagiaulacoid
Order: Primates; Suborder: Anthropoidea; Infraorder: Platyrrhini. Group containing monkeys found in the Americas.	Platyrrhines
Order: Plesiadapiformes. Archaic primates or primate-like placental mammals (Early Paleoceneâ€“Late Eocene).	Plesiadapiforms
Having features that are shared by different groups which arose from a common ancestor.	Plesiomorphic
Taxa that are basal to a given crown group but are more closely related to the crown group than to the closest living sister taxon of the crown group.	Stem
Order: Primates; Suborder: Stresirrhini. Group containing lemurs, lorises, and galagos (does not include tarsiers).	Strepsirrhines
Dental condition found in modern strepsirrhines in which the lower incisors and canines are laterally compressed and protrude forward at a nearly horizontal inclination. This structure is used in grooming.	Toothcomb
