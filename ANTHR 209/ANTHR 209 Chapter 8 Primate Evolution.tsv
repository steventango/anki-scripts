Adapoidea	Order: Primates. One of the earliest groups of euprimates (true primates; earliest records from the early Eocene).
Adaptive radiations	Rapid diversifications of single lineages into many species which may present unique morphological features in response to different ecological settings.
Ancestral traits	Features that were inherited from a common ancestor and which remain (largely) unchanged.
Anthropoids	Group containing monkeys and apes, including humans.
Auditory bulla	The rounded bony floor of the middle ear cavity.
Bilophodonty	Dental condition in which the cusps of molar teeth form ridges (or lophs) separated from each other by valleys (seen, e.g., in modern catarrhine monkeys).
Catarrhines	Order: Primates; Suborder: Anthropoidea; Infraorder: Catarrhini. Group, with origins in Africa and Asia, that contains monkeys and apes, including humans.
Clade	Group containing all of the descendants of a single ancestor. A portion of a phylogenetic tree represented as a bifurcation (node) in a lineage and all of the branches leading forward in time from that bifurcation.
Convergent evolution	The independent evolution of a morphological feature in animals not closely related (e.g., wings in birds and bats).
Crown	Smallest monophyletic group (clade) containing a specified set of extant taxa and all descendants of their last common ancestor.
Diastema	Space between adjacent teeth.
Diffuse coevolution	The ecological interaction between whole groups of species (e.g., primates) with whole groups of other species (e.g., fruiting trees).
Ectotympanic	Bony ring or tube that holds the tympanic membrane (eardrum).
Euprimates	Order: Primates. True primates or primates of modern aspect.
Haplorhines	Group containing catarrhines, platyrrhines, and tarsiers.
Hominins	Modern humans and any extinct relatives more closely related to us than to chimpanzees.
Mandibular symphysis	Fibrocartilaginous joint between the left and right mandibular segments, located in the midline of the body.
Omomyoidea	Order: Primates; Superfamily: Omomyoidea. One of the earliest groups of euprimates (true primates; earliest record in the early Eocene).
Petrosal bone	The portion of the temporal bone that houses the inner ear apparatus.
Plagiaulacoid	Dental condition where at least one of the lower cheek-teeth (molars or premolars) is a laterally compressed blade.
Platyrrhines	Order: Primates; Suborder: Anthropoidea; Infraorder: Platyrrhini. Group containing monkeys found in the Americas.
Plesiadapiforms	Order: Plesiadapiformes. Archaic primates or primate-like placental mammals (Early Paleoceneâ€“Late Eocene).
Plesiomorphic	Having features that are shared by different groups which arose from a common ancestor.
Stem	Taxa that are basal to a given crown group but are more closely related to the crown group than to the closest living sister taxon of the crown group.
Strepsirrhines	Order: Primates; Suborder: Stresirrhini. Group containing lemurs, lorises, and galagos (does not include tarsiers).
Toothcomb	Dental condition found in modern strepsirrhines in which the lower incisors and canines are laterally compressed and protrude forward at a nearly horizontal inclination. This structure is used in grooming.
