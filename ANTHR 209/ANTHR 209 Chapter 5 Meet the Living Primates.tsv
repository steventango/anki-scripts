A form of locomotion in which the organism swings below branches using the forelimbs.	Brachiation
Low, rounded cusps on the cheek teeth.	Bunodont
In most primates, these are the longest of the teeth, often conical in shape and used as a weapon against predators or others of their species.	Canines

A grouping based on ancestral relationships; a branch of the evolutionary tree.	Clade
The bumps on the chewing surface of the premolars and molars, which can be quite sharp in some species.	Cusps
The number of each type of tooth in one quadrant of the mouth, written as number of incisors: canines: premolars: molars.	Dental formula
A trait that has been recently modified, most helpful when assigning taxonomic classification.	Derived trait
A space between the teeth, usually for large canines to fit when the mouth is closed.	Diastema
Being able to see only blues and greens.	Dichromatic
Active during the day.	Diurnal
The nose and upper lip are separated and the upper lip can move independently; sometimes referred to as a “hairy” or “mobile” upper lip.	Dry nose
A subarea of anthropology that studies the complexities of human-primate relationships in the modern environment.	Ethnoprimatology
When an organism, which is limited in the time and energy it can put into aspects of its biology and behavior, is shaped by natural selection to invest in one adaptation at the expense of another.	Evolutionary trade-off
Having a diet consisting entirely of animal matter	Faunivorous
Having a diet consisting primarily of leaves.	Folivore
A depressed area in the retina at the back of the eye containing a concentration of cells that allow one to focus on objects very close to one’s face.	Fovea
Having a diet consisting primarily of fruit.	Frugivore
A trait that is useful for a wide range of tasks.	Generalized trait
A grouping based on overall similarity in lifestyle, appearance, and behavior.	Grade
A claw present on the second pedal digit in strepsirrhines.	Grooming claw
Having a diet consisting primarily of gums and saps.	Gummivore
Having different types of teeth.	Heterodont
When two or more taxa share characteristics because they inherited them from a common ancestor.	Homology
When primates sharpen their canines by wearing them on adjacent teeth.	Hone
The spatula-shaped teeth at the front of the mouth.	Incisors
Having a diet consisting primarily of insects.	Insectivore
Modified seat bones of the pelvis that are flattened and over which calluses form; function as seat pads for sitting and resting atop branches.	Ischial callosities
A form of quadrupedal movement used by Gorilla and Pan when on the ground, wherein the front limbs are supported on the knuckles of the hands.	Knuckle-walking
Refers to an organism’s pace of growth, reproduction, lifespan, etc.	Life history
How an organism moves around.	Locomotion
Refers to the alternative reproductive strategies in orangutans in which males can delay maturation, sometimes indefinitely, until a fully mature, “flanged” male disappears.	Male bimaturism
The largest teeth at the back of the mouth; used for chewing. In primates, these teeth usually have between three and five cusps.	Molars
Being able to see only in shades of light to dark, no color.	Monochromatic
When males and females of a species do not exhibit significant sexual dimorphism.	Monomorphic
Refers to the contrasting fur color of baby leaf monkeys compared to adults.	Natal coat
Active at night.	Nocturnal
Bony projection at the elbow end of the ulna.	Olecranon process
Having thumbs and toes that go in a different direction from the rest of the fingers, allows for grasping with hands and feet.	Opposable thumb or opposable big toe
Having five digits or fingers and toes.	Pentadactyly
A system in which individuals of a species vary in their abilities to see color. In primates, it refers to males being dichromatic and females being either trichromatic or dichromatic.	Polymorphic color vision
A bony ring that surrounds the eye socket, open at the back.	Postorbital bar
A bony plate that provides protection to the side and back of the eye.	Postorbital closure/plate
A tail that is able to hold the full body weight of an organism, which often has a tactile pad on the underside of the tip for improved grip.	Prehensile tail
Smaller than the molars, used for chewing. In primates, these teeth usually have one or two cusps.	Premolars
Moving around on all fours.	Quadrupedalism
Wet noses; resulting from naked skin of the nose which connects to the upper lip and smell-sensitive structures along the roof of the mouth.	Rhinariums
