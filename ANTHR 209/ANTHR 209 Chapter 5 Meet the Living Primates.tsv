Ethnoprimatology	A subarea of anthropology that studies the complexities of human-primate relationships in the modern environment.
Evolutionary trade-off	When an organism, which is limited in the time and energy it can put into aspects of its biology and behavior, is shaped by natural selection to invest in one adaptation at the expense of another.
Faunivorous	Having a diet consisting entirely of animal matter
Folivore	Having a diet consisting primarily of leaves.
Fovea	A depressed area in the retina at the back of the eye containing a concentration of cells that allow one to focus on objects very close to one’s face.
Frugivore	Having a diet consisting primarily of fruit.
Generalized trait	A trait that is useful for a wide range of tasks.
Grade	A grouping based on overall similarity in lifestyle, appearance, and behavior.
Grooming claw	A claw present on the second pedal digit in strepsirrhines.
Gummivore	Having a diet consisting primarily of gums and saps.
Heterodont	Having different types of teeth.
Homology	When two or more taxa share characteristics because they inherited them from a common ancestor.
Hone	When primates sharpen their canines by wearing them on adjacent teeth.
Incisors	The spatula-shaped teeth at the front of the mouth.
Insectivore	Having a diet consisting primarily of insects.
Ischial callosities	Modified seat bones of the pelvis that are flattened and over which calluses form; function as seat pads for sitting and resting atop branches.
Knuckle-walking	A form of quadrupedal movement used by Gorilla and Pan when on the ground, wherein the front limbs are supported on the knuckles of the hands.
Life history	Refers to an organism’s pace of growth, reproduction, lifespan, etc.
Locomotion	How an organism moves around.
Male bimaturism	Refers to the alternative reproductive strategies in orangutans in which males can delay maturation, sometimes indefinitely, until a fully mature, “flanged” male disappears.
Molars	The largest teeth at the back of the mouth; used for chewing. In primates, these teeth usually have between three and five cusps.
Monochromatic	Being able to see only in shades of light to dark, no color.
Monomorphic	When males and females of a species do not exhibit significant sexual dimorphism.
Natal coat	Refers to the contrasting fur color of baby leaf monkeys compared to adults.
Nocturnal	Active at night.
Olecranon process	Bony projection at the elbow end of the ulna.
Opposable thumb or opposable big toe	Having thumbs and toes that go in a different direction from the rest of the fingers, allows for grasping with hands and feet.
Pentadactyly	Having five digits or fingers and toes.
Polymorphic color vision	A system in which individuals of a species vary in their abilities to see color. In primates, it refers to males being dichromatic and females being either trichromatic or dichromatic.
Postorbital bar	A bony ring that surrounds the eye socket, open at the back.
Postorbital closure/plate	A bony plate that provides protection to the side and back of the eye.
Prehensile tail	A tail that is able to hold the full body weight of an organism, which often has a tactile pad on the underside of the tip for improved grip.
Premolars	Smaller than the molars, used for chewing. In primates, these teeth usually have one or two cusps.
Quadrupedalism	Moving around on all fours.
Rhinariums	Wet noses; resulting from naked skin of the nose which connects to the upper lip and smell-sensitive structures along the roof of the mouth.
Sagittal crest	A bony ridge along the top/middle of the skull, used for attachment of chewing muscles.
Scent marking	The behavior of rubbing scent glands or urine onto objects as a way of communicating with others.
Semi-brachiation	A form of locomotion in which an organism swings below branches using a combination of forelimbs and prehensile tail.
Sexually dimorphic	When a species exhibits sex differences in morphology, behavior, hormones, and/or coloration.
Shearing crests	Sharpened ridges that connect cusps on a bilophodont molar.
Specialized trait	A trait that has been modified for a specific purpose.
Styloid process of ulna	A bony projection of the ulna at the end near the wrist.
Tactile pads	Sensitive skin at the fingertips for sense of touch. Animals with a prehensile tail have a tactile pad on the underside of the tail as well.
Tapetum lucidum	Reflecting layer at the back of the eye that magnifies light.
Terrestrial	A descriptor for an organism that spends most of its time on the ground.
Tetrachromatic	Having the ability to see reds, yellows, blues, greens, and ultraviolet.

Trichromatic color vision	Being able to distinguish yellows and reds in addition to blues and greens.
Vertical clinging and leaping	A locomotor pattern in which animals are oriented upright while clinging to vertical branches, push off with hind legs, and land oriented upright on another vertical branch.
Y-5 molar	Molar cusp pattern in which five molar cusps are separated by a “Y”-shaped groove pattern.
