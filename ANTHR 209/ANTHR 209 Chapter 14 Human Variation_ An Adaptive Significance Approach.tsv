Acclimatory adjustments	Processes by which an individual organism adjusts in order to maintain homeostasis in response to environmental challenges.
Activated melanogenesis	Increase in melanin production in response to ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure.
Adaptation	Alteration in population-level gene frequencies related to environmentally induced selective pressures; leads to a greater level of fitness for a population related to a specific environment.
Adjustment	Nongenetic-based ways in which organisms adjust to environmental stressors.
Allen’s Rule	Due to thermal adaptation, homeothermic animals have body volume-to-surface ratios that vary inversely with the average temperature of their environment. In cold climates, the anticipated ratio is high; in warm climates, it is low.
Basal melanogenesis	Genetically mediated, non-environmentally influenced base melanin level.
Behavioral adjustments	An individual’s culturally mediated responses to an environmental stressor in an effort to maintain homeostasis.
Bergmann’s Rule	For a broadly distributed monophyletic group, species and populations of smaller size tend to be found in environments with warmer climates and those of larger size tend to be found in ones that are colder.
Cline	A continuum of gradations (i.e., degrees or levels) of a specific trait.
Conduction	Mechanism of heat transfer between objects through direct contact.
Convection	Movement of heat away from a warm object to the cooler surrounding fluid (i.e., gas or liquid).
Convergent evolution	Evolutionary process whereby organisms that are not closely related independently evolve similar traits as a product of adaptation to similar evolutionary parameters.
Erythrocyte	Red blood cell; most common form of blood cell; the principle means of transporting oxygen throughout the circulatory system.
Evaporation	Mechanism of heat transfer whereby liquid is transformed into a gas, utilizing energy (e.g., heat).
Folic acid	Form of B complex vitamin necessary for proper fetal development.
Gloger’s Rule	For mammals of the same species, those with more darkly pigmented forms tend to be found closer to the equator and those with lighter forms are found in regions further from the equator.
Homeostasis	Condition of optimal functioning for an organism.
Hyperpnea	Increased depth and rate of respiration.
Hypothalamus	Small portion of the human brain responsible for body temperature regulation.
Lactase persistence	Genetic mutation permitting the continued production of lactase-phlorizin hydrolase enzyme in the small intestine past the weaning period.
Melanin	Black-brown pigment produced by melanocytes; one of the primary pigments in skin.
Melanocytes	Specialized cells that produce melanin.
Phenotypic plasticity	Ability of one genotype to produce more than one phenotype dependent on environmental conditions.
Radiation	Mechanism of heat transfer involving electromagnetic energy being emitted from an object.
Sickle cell disease	A group of genetically inherited blood disorders characterized by an abnormality in the shape of the hemoglobin within erythrocytes (red blood cells).
Stressor	Any stimulus resulting in an imbalance in an organism’s homeostatic balance.
Vasoconstriction	Narrowing of the blood vessels due to contractions of the muscular vessel walls.
Vasodilation	Dilation of the blood vessels due to relaxation of the muscular vessel walls.
