Processes by which an individual organism adjusts in order to maintain homeostasis in response to environmental challenges.	Acclimatory adjustments
Increase in melanin production in response to ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure.	Activated melanogenesis
Alteration in population-level gene frequencies related to environmentally induced selective pressures; leads to a greater level of fitness for a population related to a specific environment.	Adaptation
Nongenetic-based ways in which organisms adjust to environmental stressors.	Adjustment
Due to thermal adaptation, homeothermic animals have body volume-to-surface ratios that vary inversely with the average temperature of their environment. In cold climates, the anticipated ratio is high; in warm climates, it is low.	Allen’s Rule
Genetically mediated, non-environmentally influenced base melanin level.	Basal melanogenesis
An individual’s culturally mediated responses to an environmental stressor in an effort to maintain homeostasis.	Behavioral adjustments
For a broadly distributed monophyletic group, species and populations of smaller size tend to be found in environments with warmer climates and those of larger size tend to be found in ones that are colder.	Bergmann’s Rule
A continuum of gradations (i.e., degrees or levels) of a specific trait.	Cline
Mechanism of heat transfer between objects through direct contact.	Conduction
Movement of heat away from a warm object to the cooler surrounding fluid (i.e., gas or liquid).	Convection
Evolutionary process whereby organisms that are not closely related independently evolve similar traits as a product of adaptation to similar evolutionary parameters.	Convergent evolution
Red blood cell; most common form of blood cell; the principle means of transporting oxygen throughout the circulatory system.	Erythrocyte
Mechanism of heat transfer whereby liquid is transformed into a gas, utilizing energy (e.g., heat).	Evaporation
Form of B complex vitamin necessary for proper fetal development.	Folic acid
For mammals of the same species, those with more darkly pigmented forms tend to be found closer to the equator and those with lighter forms are found in regions further from the equator.	Gloger’s Rule
Condition of optimal functioning for an organism.	Homeostasis
Increased depth and rate of respiration.	Hyperpnea
Small portion of the human brain responsible for body temperature regulation.	Hypothalamus
Genetic mutation permitting the continued production of lactase-phlorizin hydrolase enzyme in the small intestine past the weaning period.	Lactase persistence
Black-brown pigment produced by melanocytes; one of the primary pigments in skin.	Melanin
Specialized cells that produce melanin.	Melanocytes
Ability of one genotype to produce more than one phenotype dependent on environmental conditions.	Phenotypic plasticity
Mechanism of heat transfer involving electromagnetic energy being emitted from an object.	Radiation
A group of genetically inherited blood disorders characterized by an abnormality in the shape of the hemoglobin within erythrocytes (red blood cells).	Sickle cell disease
Any stimulus resulting in an imbalance in an organism’s homeostatic balance.	Stressor
Narrowing of the blood vessels due to contractions of the muscular vessel walls.	Vasoconstriction
Dilation of the blood vessels due to relaxation of the muscular vessel walls.	Vasodilation
